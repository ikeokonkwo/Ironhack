				The final tool in the xScope bag of tricks is the Crosshair. This is a simple tool that helps you locate and align points on screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				By default, the Crosshair reports positions relative to the upper left-hand corner of the screen. You can, however, set any point as the origin&mdash;this allows you to get positions that are relative to an arbitrary point on the screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use âŒ˜0 (<span class="menuitem">Set Center Now</span>) to set the Crosshair origin using the current mouse position. After the new origin is set, the tool will display the offset from that position.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're a Mac software developer, you may want to adjust the origin of the Crosshair. By default, it's in the upper-left corner of the screen, but there is a preference to make it in the lower-left (and compatible with AppKit's coordinate system.)
			</p>
			<div class="tip">
				<p>
				The color of the Crosshair tool can be set using the preference panel. If you're working on a design that contains both light and dark elements, try using <span class="menuitem">Adjust  color automatically for maximum contrast</span>. When this option is selected, the colors near the mouse cursor are analyzed and black or white is chosen so the line can be seen easily.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Finally, the Crosshair tool can be effective when used in conjunction with the other tools. Try turning on the Loupe to get a close up of the current position. The Guides and Frames tools can also benefit from a crosshair&mdash;allowing quick position measurements without creating a new guide or frame.
